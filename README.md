# CryptopiaTrader
iOS app for interacting with Cryptopia.co.nz


CryptopiaTrader allows you to check the markets of Cryptopia.co.nz. The app also allows you to submit trades and manage your orders. Besides this you can also check your balances and previous trades.

This is not an official app from the creators of Cryptopia.co.nz

The developer will not be held liable for any losses that occur trough the app.

The app has been sent to the App store for review many times, but the review team always rejected it due to legal issues. Even though the app is completely functional it can not be uploaded to the App store.

The same thing that happened to this developer happened to me as well. You can find his story here: http://johannes.plunien.com/2017/09/apple-reject-cryptocurrency-apps.html
